## Processing
Some merging of precincts in the tabular election data and precinct shapefile were necessary to join election results to precinct boundaries. Data from absentee votes reported at the county level were disaggregated to precincts by voting age population. Demographic data were aggregated from blocks to precincts using MGGGâ€™s proration software. Congressional and state legislative district IDs were also assigned to precincts using this package.
